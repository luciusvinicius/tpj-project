-Polish player state machine, possibly making it a single entity with "walking", "jumping" and "falling" states. As it is now, 
 the movement is a bit rough, both in terms of input and transistions.

-Physics component should work in an isoalted manner. After initiazlizing one of these types of components, just attaching them to an
 actor should provide the actor with physics out of the box. This means that from the engine side, one should be able to just say to
 the physics component to do its thing, and this is able to be done interannly by the component, without needing anything else.
 TLDR: make Physics component "update" work the same way as Graphical component's "render" aka no arguments needed. Besides, constants
 gravity shouldnt depend on parameters. Gravity should be a constant defined at the engine level, and then each physics component could 
 have a mass var that affects how the object that is attached to the component behaves.
